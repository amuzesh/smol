A MYSTERIOUS NIGHT<br /><br />
The door opened and Madame Bonacieux spoke to a young woman inside. D'Artagnan watched as they exchanged handkerchiefs. What does this mean ? he wondered<br />
When Madame Bonacieux left and hurried down to street, D'artagnan ran after her. he touched her shoulder and she cried out.<br />
"it's you !" she said. "oh, thank goodness. why you have followed me?"<br />
"I was about to visit my friend. he lives in that house. do you knows Aramis?"<br />
"I don," she said. i was talking to a woman."<br />
"Who is she?"<br />
"that is secret ," she said. "if you still want to help me, please walk with me. to my next meeting. once we arrive, you must go."<br />
D'Artagnan did not want to leave her, especially with so many guards and secret flying above. but when they arrived at her destination, he agreed to go home. back at this apartemen, planchet told D'Artagnan that he had only been able to bring Tattoos back. but some mere guard had come and arrested him!<br />
"they, thought he was you", Planchet said "he told me," D'Artagnan said, "I must find Monsieur de Trēvillie and tell him what has happened will you stay here? you're not afraid"<br />
"Don't worry," Planchet said. "I can be brave when i put my mind to it."<br />
on his way to Monsieur de Trēvillie’s mansion, D'Artagnan saw a man and woman walking together. the man wore a Musketeer's uniform. D'Artagnan thought he looked like Aramis, so he ran to them. the man turned as well. it was  Madame Bonacieux again!<br />
"I had your promise," she said. "you swore you would follow me.”<br />
"I'm sorry. I thought this man was someone else," D'Artagnan said.<br />
"please take my arm, Madame," The man said.<br />
"let us go on."<br />
D'Artagnan was confused and wouldn't move out of their way, so the man stepped forward and pushed him aside. D'Artagnan and the man both drew their swords.<br />
“My Lord, don't fight!” Madame Bonacieux said.<br />
“My Lord?” D'Artagnan said. “can you possibly be------”<br />
“It’s the Duke of Buckingham,” Madame Bonacieux said. “And now you may have ruined us all!”<br />
“Please forgive me,” D'Artagnan said. “I only wanted protect her.”<br />
“You are worthy young man,” said the Duke. “If you wish to help, follow us a distance. <br />
“If you see anyone else following us, attack them.’’<br />
D'Artagnan followed behind Madame Bonacieux and the Duke through many dark an secret passages. Finally they reached one of the Queen’s room.<br />
When the Queen entered, the Duke was struck by her beauty. She was twenty-six, with eyes that sparkled like emeralds. The Duke knceled at her feet.<br />
“My Lord Duke,” the Queen said. “You must already know that I did not invite you here.”<br />
“I know.” He said. “But I am in love with you and I wanted to see you again.”<br />
“You must listen to me,” she said. “Our kingdoms separate us. We must never meet again. Remember, I never told you that I loved you.” <br />
“But you never said that you didn’t love me,” he said.<br />
It was true that she loved him, but it was too dangerous. If the king found out, the Duke’s life would be in danger and the scandal could lead to a war with England. Just then, as if reading her thoughts, the Duke told her he wanted their kingdoms to go war.<br />
“A war ends in peace,” he explained. “And peace requires an ambassador such as myself to come back to France and  sign the papers. Then I shall see you again and no one will be able to stop me.”<br />
“You are a foolish man,” the Queen said. “You must go now. I don’t want see you harmed.”<br />
“Madame, let me beg for an object from you, something to prove that I’m not dreaming,” said the Duke.<br />
“will you leave France and return to England?” the Queen asked<br />
“I swear it.” <br />
She went into her room, and returned with a small wooden jewelry box.<br />
“My Lord, here is s gift for you to remember me by the Queen said <br />
The Duke fell to one knee.<br />
“You promised to leave,” the Queen reminded him.<br />
“I shall be true to my word, Your Highness the Duke said. “Just give me your hand, and I’ll go”<br />
Her eyes closed, the queen offered him one hand, and leaned with the other on the table, for she felt as if she was about to faint. Passionately, the Duke pressed his lips to her fingertips, then rose and left the room.<br /> ente berada di tempat yang benar.
