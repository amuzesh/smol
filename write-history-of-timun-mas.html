                    <strong>Jawaban: #1:</strong>
            <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p></p><p>Once in Java, there was a poor widow named Mbok Srini who lived alone in her modest house on the edge of the forest.  He felt very lonely and prayed to the gods to bless him with a child.  One night in his dream, he imagined something wrapped under a jungle tree.  He considers this dream as a sign, the answer to his prayer.  He then went to the forest to look for something wrapped in a cloth under a tree, he hoped to find a baby to care for.  Finally he found an object wrapped in cloth under a tree just like his vision in his dream.  When he unwrapped the wrapper, there was no baby in the cloth wrapped but only cucumber seeds.  Suddenly he heard a terrible laugh;  a green-skinned giant named Butho Ijo (in Javanese, meaning "Green Giant") appeared behind him.  The green giant told him to plant cucumber seeds and he would have children.  He had to take care of the child, but when the child grew up, Mbok Srini had to return the child to Butho Ijo.  The giant wants to eat the child.  Because she wanted to have children, Mbok Srini agreed with the Butho Ijo agreement.</p><p></p><p> Mbok Srini returned to her house and planted cucumber seeds in her backyard garden.  Then, a golden golden cucumber grew from its seeds, and when Mbok Srini took the cucumber and opened it, a beautiful baby girl appeared in it.  So, he named the baby girl Timun Mas which means "golden cucumber". Year after year, Timun Mas grows into a beautiful girl.  He is a loving, kind, and diligent child who is always willing to help and care for the elderly Mbok Srini.  Just a week before Timun Mas's 17th birthday, Butho Ijo appeared in front of Mbok Srini's house and reminded him of his promise, and announced that in one week he would return to collect Timun Mas.  Mbok Srini is very sad and afraid of the terrible fate that awaits her beloved child.  Mbok Srini heard that there was a strong rishi on a nearby mountain.  He hurriedly went to the mountain to seek help from a wise hermit who lived in the mountain. After hearing the story, the old hermit gave him four small cloth bags with something in them.  The four items in the bag are cucumber seeds, needles, salt and shrimp paste (shrimp paste).  The hermit asked Mbok Srini to give these items to Timun Mas and told him to throw them when he was chased by a giant.  Mbok Srini returned home and told Timun Mas what to do if the green giant chased him.</p><p></p><p> Finally on Timun Mas's 17th birthday, Butho Ijo appeared at Mbok Srini's house to take Timun Mas as promised: he would eat the girl.  Mbok Srini ordered Timun Mas to run for his life.  Timun Mas was really scared and scared and ran as fast as he could to try to escape from the giant.  The giant was furious and destroyed Mbok Srini's house while chasing Timun Mas.  Finally, Butho Ijo overtook Timun Mas who ran away. In his distress, Timun Mas opened one of his four cloth bags spreading cucumber seeds behind him. Suddenly a large cucumber vine appeared and choked the giant's body, trapping him so he could not move.  This gave Timun Mas time to escape further.  But the powerful giant finally managed to free himself and continue his pursuit.  Timun Mas opened his second bag and spread the needle behind him.  Suddenly the needle turned into a bamboo forest with a sharp tip that wounded the giant.  The giant was badly injured trapped with sharp bamboo, but he made it through the sharp bamboo forest and chased Timun Mas who was running again.  He opened his third bag and sprinkled salt behind him.  Suddenly a sea appeared behind him to drown the evil giant.  But the giant managed to swim through the sea and kept chasing him.  Timun Mas, once again, almost caught and opened his last bag.  He threw the shrimp paste behind him and continued to run desperately.  Shrimp paste suddenly turned into a sea of boiling volcanic mud.  Butho Ijo trapped in hot mud that boils, sinks and dies.  Timun Mas finally survived and returned to his mother Mbok Srini, and they lived happily ever after.</p><p></p><p>jdikan jwbn yg terbaik y:)))</p>
                    <strong>Jawaban: #2:</strong>
            <p><u><em><strong>Timun Mas</strong></em></u><strong>                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Long time ago, lived an old women named Mbok Sirni. She lived by herself because her husband had long passed away and she had no children. Every day, she prayed so God would give her a child. One night, when she was praying, a giant passed her house and heard her pray. “I can give you a child on one condition,” the giant said to Mbok Sirni, “You must give the child back to me when it is six years old.” Mbok Sirni was so happy; she did not think about the risk of losing the child later and agreed to take the giant’s offer. The giant then gave her a bunch of cucumber seeds. “Plant it around your house.” The giant then left without saying anything else. In the morning, Mbok Sirni planted the seeds. The seeds grew within mere days, and blossomed plentifully.Not longer after that, a big golden cucumber grew from plants. Carefully, Mbok Sirni plucked the golden cucumber and carried it home. With caution and care, she sliced the cucumber. She was very surprised to see a beautiful baby girl inside the cucumber. She then named the baby Timun Emas.Years passed by and Timun Emas has grew to become a lovely and beautiful little girl. She was also smart and kind. Mbok Sirni loved her very much. But she kept thinking about the time the giant would take Timun Emas away from her. One night, Mbok Sirni had a dream. In order to save Timun Emas from the giant, she had to meet the holy man who lived in Mount Gundul. The next morning, Mbok Sirni took leave of Timun Emas to go to Mount Gundul. The holy man then gave her four little bags, each one containing cucumber seeds, needles, salt, and shrimp paste. “Timun Emas can use these to protect herself,” said the holy man to Mbok Sirni.A few days later, the giant came to see Mbok Sirni about her promise. “Mbok Sirni! Where is Timun Emas?” shouted the giant. “My daughter, take these bag with you. It can save you from the giant. Now, run through the back door,” said Mbok Sirni. But the giant saw Timun Emas running to the woods. The giant was angry. Starved and enraged, he rushed toward Timun Emas. Mbok Sirni tried to stop him, but the giant was unstoppable.The giant was getting closer and closer, so Timun Emas opened the first bag she got from Mbok Sirni. Inside the bag were cucumber seeds. She threw the seeds, and instantly they grew into large cucumber field. But the giant ate them all, giving him more strength. As the giant was getting close, Timun Emas took the second bag with needles inside and spilled the content behind her. The needles turned into bamboo trees, sharp and thorny. The giant’s body was scratched and bled. “Aaargh, I’ll get you, Timun Emas!” shouted the giant as he tried to get himself out from the bamboo field. He made it and still chasing Timun Emas.Timun Emas then reached the third bag and spilled the salt inside. The ground which the salt touched turned into a deep sea. The giant almost drown and had to swim to cross the sea. After some time, he managed to get out from the water. Timun Emas saw the giant coming, so she reached for the last bag. She took the shrimp paste and threw it. The shrimp paste became a big swamp of boiling mud. The giant was trapped in the middle of the swamp. The mud slowly but surely drowned him. Helpless, he roared out, “Help! Heeeeelp…!” Then the giant drown and died. Timun Mas then immediately went home. Since then, Timun Emas and Mbok Sirni live happily ever after.</strong></p>
